Archivist readme
================

There is no friendly interface to set things up, if you are not comfortable with editing JSON files then
this program is probably not for you, sorry about that.

The program will not work after being installed, you first need to tell it which folders you want it to 
archived, where to put the archives and optionally, where to copy them to from there.

See documentation at https://github.com/silentdiverchris/Archivist#readme for full details.
